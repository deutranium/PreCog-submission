# Data Parsing and Storage

## Task A
I was able to convert the tables in [1c1edeee-a13e-4b2e-90be-eb1dd03c3384.pdf](./Rec_Task/1c1edeee-a13e-4b2e-90be-eb1dd03c3384.pdf) and [a6b29367-f3b7-4fb1-a2d0-077477eac1d9.pdf](./Rec_Task/a6b29367-f3b7-4fb1-a2d0-077477eac1d9.pdf) to their respective MongoDB collections due to certain wrong estimates for time management.

**Script:** [a.py](./a.py)

**Mongo DB collection:** [tables/](./tables/)

## Task B
**Script:** [b.py](./b.py)

**Mongo DB collection:** [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p1TL8wlYQ1sH2zgrQHRP5KTpXM4yWazz?usp=sharing)

*I was not able to read the files through Python because of their large size. A workaround was using Google Colab and using their computation power. But by the time I realised this, there wasn't enough time to complete the task as required.*
